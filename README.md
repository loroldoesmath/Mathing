# Mathing ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¢

Welcome to **Mathing**â€”my personal corner on the internet where I get to explore prime numbers because, well, they're cool. ðŸ¤“ 

## What's This All About?
This repository contains some of my research projects and scripts that I work on for fun. The initial focus here is **cousin primes**, but Iâ€™m fascinated by all types of relational prime classifications.

### Asymptotic Density of Cousin Primes
One project I'm diving into is looking at the **asymptotic density of cousin primes**. Cousin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 4 (for example, 3 and 7). I recently wrote a Python script that plots how the density of these primes changes as we go higher and higher in the prime number sequence.

Here's a quick visual of the **asymptotic density of cousin primes** up to 1000:

### Where Is This Going?
Honestly, Iâ€™m just having fun with this, but I hope to dig deeper into how the **asymptotic density** varies as a function of different **prime classifications**. Iâ€™m curious if primes in other special categories (like twin primes, Sophie Germain primes, etc.) show similar trends or behave in surprising ways.

Feel free to poke around and check out the scripts. And hey, if you're also into primes, reach outâ€”I'd love to talk numbers!

## How to Use the Scripts
Clone this repo and check out the Python scripts. Youâ€™ll need `sympy` and `matplotlib` to run most of them. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mathing.git
cd mathing
pip install -r requirements.txt
